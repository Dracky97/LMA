# Leave Policy Logic Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Leave Policy Logic Specification for the Leave Management Application. The system now supports comprehensive leave entitlement calculations based on employee join date and current year.

## 🎯 Implemented Features

### 1. Leave Entitlements Logic

The system now implements three distinct leave conditions based on employee join date:

#### Condition A: Current Year Joiner
- **Annual Leave**: 0 days
- **Sick Leave**: 7 days
- **Casual Leave**: 0.5 × completed months of service

#### Condition B: Previous Year Joiner
- **Sick Leave**: 7 days
- **Casual Leave**: 7 days
- **Annual Leave**: Based on join date lookup table

#### Condition C: Long-term Employee
- **Annual Leave**: 14 days
- **Sick Leave**: 7 days
- **Casual Leave**: 7 days

### 2. Annual Leave Lookup Table (Previous Year Joiners)

| Join Date Range | Annual Leave Entitlement |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Q1 (Jan 1 - Mar 31) | 14 days |
| Q2 (Apr 1 - Jun 30) | 10 days |
| Q3 (Jul 1 - Sep 30) | 7 days |
| Q4 (Oct 1 - Dec 31) | 4 days |

### 3. Short Leave Policy

- **Monthly Allowance**: 3 hours per month
- **Maximum per Request**: 2 hours
- **Validation**: Cannot apply for 3+ hours in a single request

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`lib/leavePolicy.js`** - Core policy logic implementation
2. **`components/LeavePolicyInfo.js`** - UI components for policy display

### Modified Files
1. **`components/LeaveRequestModal.js`** - Integrated short leave validation
2. **`components/dashboards/HRManagerDashboard.js`** - Added policy management features

## 🔧 Key Functions Implemented

### Core Policy Functions (`lib/leavePolicy.js`)

#### `calculateLeaveEntitlements(joinDate, currentYear)`
Calculates leave entitlements based on the employee's join date and current year.

```javascript
// Example usage
const entitlements = calculateLeaveEntitlements('2023-03-15', 2024);
// Returns: { annualLeave: 10, sickLeave: 7, casualLeave: 7, condition: 'B' }
```

#### `validateShortLeave(requestedHours, usedHoursThisMonth, requestDate)`
Validates short leave requests against policy constraints.

```javascript
// Example usage
const validation = validateShortLeave(1.5, 1.0);
// Returns: { isValid: true, remainingHoursThisMonth: 2.0, errors: [] }
```

#### `calculateCompletedMonths(joinDate, currentDate)`
Calculates completed months of service for Condition A employees.

#### `getQuarterInfo(joinDate)`
Provides quarterly information for annual leave calculation (Condition B).

### UI Components (`components/LeavePolicyInfo.js`)

#### `LeavePolicyInfo(employee, year)`
Displays detailed leave policy information for a specific employee.

#### `LeavePolicyReference()`
Shows the complete policy reference guide.

## 🔄 Bulk Operations

### Calculate All Leave Balances
HR can now automatically calculate and update leave balances for all employees based on the new policy:

3. **Batch Processing**: Updates all employees with a single operation
4. **Error Handling**: Reports individual failures while continuing with others

## 🧮 Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Current Year Joiner
- **Join Date**: March 15, 2024
- **Current Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Completed Months**: 9 months (March 2024 to January 2026)
- **Entitlements**:
  - Annual Leave: 0 days
  - Sick Leave: 7 days
  - Casual Leave: 4.5 days (0.5 × 9 months)

### Example 2: Previous Year Joiner
- **Join Date**: May 20, 2023
- **Current Year**: 2024
- **Condition**: B (Previous year joiner)
- **Quarter**: Q2 (Apr-Jun)
- **Entitlements**:
  - Annual Leave: 10 days
  - Sick Leave: 7 days
  - Casual Leave: 7 days

### Example 3: Long-term Employee
- **Join Date**: January 10, 2020
- **Current Year**: 2024
- **Condition**: C (Before previous year)
- **Entitlements**:
  - Annual Leave: 14 days
  - Sick Leave: 7 days
  - Casual Leave: 7 days
